A Play application
=================================

Play uses htmlUnit for creating integration tests
e.g. execute a call to local host via htmlUnit headless browser
then parse results in  integrationSpec to enable tests
e.g. 
class IntegrationSpec extends PlaySpec with OneServerPerTest with OneBrowserPerTest with HtmlUnitFactory {

  "Application" should {

    "work from within a browser" in {

      go to ("http://localhost:" + port)

      pageSource must include ("Your new application is ready.")
    }
  }
}

Controllers
===========

- HomeController.scala:

  Shows how to handle simple html unit headless browser
  a chart controller to gen highcharts chart locally
Learninngs:
 html unit retuns complete html and javascript with from a url
 but export does not executes javascript properly so that chart is converted to html on the fly
 page.getXml get all the xml which can then be parsed
